<p id="announcement"><b>Announcement 8 July 2016: </b>We are currently looking to purchase 20 low-cost (~$200-$250), long-battery-life laptops for our Creative Kids Ghana project. Our current interest is with Google Chromebook devices due to their reliability. Other options are also being considered. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0yogm1QuxjMlHJQD0PaGzlVfqV6iZeVGgNaVStF4T4/edit?usp=sharing">message to suppliers</a> and contact Rhys at <a href="mailto:rhys@creativekidssa.com.au">rhys@creativekidssa.com.au</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>Who Are We?</h1>

<p style="font-style: italic">We are a not-for-profit organisation, focused upon the development of computer science education, particularly among youth in disadvantaged or underprivileged areas. We believe that every child should have the chance to learn about some of the most powerful ideas in computer science.</p>

<p>We teach children about <i>creative computer programming</i>, showing them that it is a fun and powerful way to develop computational thinking skills as well as be exposed to some of the main ideas of computer science.</p>
<p>We do this by offering schools a range of professional development sessions, workshops and learning materials helping to facilitate the growth of creative computer science education. Our sessions are interactive and fun, yet challenging. <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/HardFun.html">Hard Fun</a>. Generally, all that is required is a computer for each student.</p>

<p>Learning in this area connects to many other school curriculum areas with a special emphasis on science, the arts and mathematics. We also tailor our programs to suit the specific needs of the school and wider community by providing connections between existing themes and topics as well as the local context.</p>

<p>Our facilitators are highly trained and have extensive experience teaching computer science to all age groups. In addition, we share all our learning materials online under a license that respects a user's freedom. We also ensure that all educational software used is under a similar license. As a whole at Creative Kids, we sincerely look forward to working with you and joining with you in sharing this exciting learning area with the children at your school!</p>
