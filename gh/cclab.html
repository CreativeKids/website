<p id="announcement"><b>Announcement 8 July 2016: </b>We are currently looking to purchase 20 low-cost (~$200-$250), long-battery-life laptops for our Creative Kids Ghana project. Our current interest is with Google Chromebook devices due to their reliability. Other options are also being considered. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0yogm1QuxjMlHJQD0PaGzlVfqV6iZeVGgNaVStF4T4/edit?usp=sharing">message to suppliers</a> and contact Rhys at <a href="mailto:rhys@creativekidssa.com.au">rhys@creativekidssa.com.au</a> for more information.</p>
    <h1>Creative Kids Ghana - Creative Computing Lab</h1>



<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>The Creative Kids Ghana, Creative Computing Lab is located in Teshie, Ghana at the <a href="http://www.futureleaders-ucc.org">Future Leaders Underprivileged Children's Centre</a>. It provides primary school students an opportunity to learn about creative computer programming and also serves as a technology learning space for the community of Teshie.</p>

    <h1>Project History - The Future Leaders UCC Creative Computing Lab</h1>

    <h2>March 2014</h2>
    <p>The beginnings of Creative Kids GH was inspired when Rhys decided to leave his position as a Technical Incubator Fellow at the <a href="http://www.meltwater.org/">Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology</a> (MEST) in East Legon, Ghana. Looking to do something a little different, but still connected to education, a friend suggested getting involved with the <a href="http://www.futureleaders-ucc.org/">Future Leaders Underprivileged Children's Centre</a> (UCC) located in Teshie, Accra. Founded under a mango tree by a Ghanain man named Billa Mamud in 1998 and focussed upon serving some of the poorest children in Teshie and Labadi, the Future Leaders UCC school seemed like an ideal and worthwhile project to get involved in.</p>

    <h2>June 2014</h2>
    <p>
        Having first visited the centre in March 2013, Rhys was inspired to contribute. Recognising that students at the school were unlikely to ever encounter a computer, he thought it would be a good idea to provide students with an opportunity to do so.

        <blockquote>What inspired me in undertaking this project? I guess I looked back at my own primary school experiences. My passion for technology was developed very early on. I can distinctly recall memories during primary school in which I had the opportunity to experiment with and get excited about technology, even if the teachers had very little working knowledge of computers! Without these early experiences, I am unsure if I would have pursued an education and career related to computer science. </blockquote>

    With this in mind, he returned to the school again, packing up a suitcase full of Raspberry Pi computers, LCD monitors, keyboards, mice, power cables, power boards and other accessories required for a computer lab at the school. Prior to arriving, a building had already been set-up for use as an 'ICT lab', yet no functioning computers existed!

    <h2>January 2015</h2>
    <p>
        Rhys returned to the school again, focussing this time upon learning more about primary school teaching in Ghana. Students continued to learn about 'ICT' with a designated 'ICT teacher' following the Ghanaian ICT curriculum which mostly consisted of application use (such as learning to type, creating/printing documents and using an operating system) rather than constructive, creative projects that are at the heart of computer science.

    <h2>June 2016</h2>
    <p>
        Inspired by the teaching he had been doing back home in Adelaide with Creative Kids SA (particularly with MIT's <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> software), and having a month off from his work lecturing in computer science at SAIBT, Rhys returned to the Future Leaders UCC school. Rhys wanted to focus this time upon teaching, rather than equipment set-up and configuration and therefore planned to teach all children in classes 4, 5, and 6 creative computer programming with Scratch. Rhys raised $1,333 AUD to provide Internet and additional laptops to the ICT lab at the school, renamed it the 'Creative Computing Lab' and provided each student in class 4, 5 and 6 with at least three 1.5 hour lessons about creative computing and computational thinking with Scratch. Rhys plans to return to the school again in September 2016, to continue these lessons over another intensive period.
