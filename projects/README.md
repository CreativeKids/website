# Creative Computer Science Projects
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CreativeKids/projects.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CreativeKids/projects)

This repository contains creative computer science projects designed to inspire children in learning about some of the most powerful ideas in computer science.

Each project is designed to be engaging, fun and interesting with the goal that children wish to explore the concepts further on their own projects.
